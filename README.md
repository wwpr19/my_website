Rubric Section "Responsive Web Design: All pages of your site must employ RWD strategies we learned in class so that your page looks good at a variety of screen widths, including mobile devices!"

There is a break in your navigation page at about 780px. I would recommend to setup your navigation bar to be vertical at this point. Set your @media max width to 780px instead of 600px.

        *I changed the 600px to 780ox and it improved my navigation bar so that it didnt break at 600
        *I added a hamberger menu when the screen is small

On a few of your pages you have a text box with green text over a slightly green background. I found the text a little difficult to read due to the low contrast.

        *I changed the shadow of text to make it more legible

The section of your home page that lists links to your competitors looks out of place with all the nice, clean formatting around it, then this random plain text with some links. It would be nice to see it more in line with the rest of your page. 

"All pages of your site must employ basic Web Accessibility strategies we learned in class, including alt attributes for all images and clearly legible text (consider both font & choice of contrasting colors)"

        *I fixed the links and add styles to them.
